	Jquery loads (load method) pages only on running on the server either local or live.
	Go to Extension and search for live server and install it.
	open project folder then IYRIX, then public then
	To run any of your page open page in vs code and then open with live server 
	Disclaimer if any html file you open and not opened in decent view then perhaps you have opened only single component (not a page file) so go back open any other file.
